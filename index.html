    <h2>Platinum: Mr. Robot</h2>
    <p><span>Mr. Robot</span> centers around Elliot Alderson, a highly gifted hacker who suffers from severe social anxiety and mental health struggles, as he is recruited by the mysterious "Mr. Robot" to execute a hack that will attempt to take down a corrupted and corporate-ruled government while dealing a killing blow to capitalism as we know it. Elliot must now come to terms with his place in the upcoming cyber revolution, all the while wrestling with his conflicted desires and a steadily decreasing grip on reality. Filled with twists, turns, conflict and emotion, Mr. Robot is a gripping and surprisingly touching show (and often times a wildly brain-melting show as well), and it features some of the best performances found on television. It also manages to stay impressively accurate in its depiction of hacking, technology and code.</p>

    <h2>Gold: Breaking Bad</h2>
    <p><span>Breaking Bad</span> follows Walter White, an extremely overqualified high school chemistry teacher who is filled with regret over missed oppurtunities and his own wasted potential. Things are only made worse when he receives a lung cancer diagnosis, the treatment for which is set to devastate his family (that is already struggling financially). Walter, who sees no recourse in dealing with the upcoming financial strain, comes up with a desperate plan. Using his incredible knowledge of chemistry, he teams up with a former student, Jesse Pinkman, to cook and distribute crystal meth; in this arrangement, Walter is responsible for the chemistry and Jesse is responsible for the distribution. Walter quickly discovers that there is plenty of money to be made in the drug game, especially when the product is far superior to anything else currently on the market. However, he also finds that it is filled with danger too... not just from sketchy customers and rival gangs/distributors, but also due to the inconvinient fact that his brother in law is a DEA agent. What unfolds is nothing short of a breathtaking depiction of television drama, one that is packed from start to finish with tight pacing, expert storytelling, and some acting that is utterly unreal.</p>

    <h2>Silver: The Expanse</h2>
    <p>Set a couple hundred years in the future, <span>The Expanse</span> offers a glimpse of humanity that is advanced enough to colonize much of the solar system, but not yet at the point that many epic sci-fi stories deal with in which the entire universe is accessable just by turning on "light-speed" or "hyperdrive." Instead, The Expanse focuses on a more grounded story of science fiction, one in which the different factions of the colonized solar system are competing for power and their own individual goals. Earth just wants to maintain their dominant position over the system, Mars wants to fully teraform their planet so as to be truly independent from Earth, and the people of the outer planets/moons (referred to as the "belt") long to be a more significant part of the system instead of being used to mine resources for the inner planets. As these factions conflict and teeter on the brink of war, a mysterious 'alien' threat is looming in the background. Surrounding this threat is a mysterious conspiracy that may just determine whether humanity can evolve with whatever may be out there, or if their collective greed and short-sitedness will result in them being consumed by it. The Expanse boasts excellent characters that are spread out across the system, all of whom have different homes, backgrounds, personalities and ideas for what human society should be. The show follows these people, some of whom will form unlikely alliances and others who will become bitter enemies, as they watch the universe change forever from each of their individual perspectives. That's what The Expanse is really about, seeing the biggest moments and paradigm shifts in human history through the eyes of the people living through those times. It makes for a fascinating concept filled with thought-provoking themes, as well as a complex and thrilling show to boot.</p>

    <h2>Bronze: Dark</h2>
    <p>It's hard to say too much about the story of <span>Dark</span> without giving away crucial plot reveals, but in short it follows a small and close-knit town as strange occurences begin to drastically interfere with the lives of those who live there. It starts with a young student at the local high school going missing, but it doesn't take long for even more strange and disconcerting events to take place, many of which seem to ignore what is known to be possible. As things continue to progress, it becomes clear that something big is happening, and that the lives of everyone in this town may be connected in a strange but vital way. As each individual character navigates this growing mystery, a complex narrative is revealed that suggest the conflict is more dire than many have realized. Though there isn't much else to say about the story without giving it away, it can definitely be said that Dark is as gripping as it is complicated. There may not be another show that features a plot that is this intricate, detailed and complexed... but if you can wrap your head around it, you're in for a wild ride that is practically guarenteed to blow your mind.</p>
